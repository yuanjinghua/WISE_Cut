# Making WISE Cutout/Mosaic Using Montage Wapper

The main script for cutting/mosaicing images is **WISE_cutout.py**. 

Runing this script needs a local pool of ALLWISE tiles which can be downloaded using the four ***bash*** scripts (this maybe very time consuming for building a local data pool). 


This script can be used for making small cutouts and large mosaics. A mosaic of 2.5 degree X 2.5 degree for the Andromeda Galaxy is shown bellow as an example.
